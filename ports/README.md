# LocalPy

This folder contains the ports to each server you make. When you first download this repo and run the app, a sub-folder in here will be created.
Then open the folder with your port and create files (we reccomend adding a `index.html` file).
Then open your localhost and then volia! The files will be saved on your localhost
